# colorgame
It's a simple color and text game.
In this game, different color names will be displayed with different text colors.
Here in this game, the role of a player is to enter the correct color of the word which is displayed on the screen.
Each time when the player enters the correct color the score will be incremented by one.
And the game duration will be 60 seconds.

The above code will create a window inside which I have placed some description of the game and how to play the game.
Then I have placed some labels which display the current score, words with different colors and count down timer.
And entry box to enter the color name.
The game begins when the player hits the ENTER BUTTON.

The code above will create an interface like this.
